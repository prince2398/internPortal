- After registering, the employer is able to post internships, with bare minimum details. Internship posting is restricted only to an employer and a student as well as a non-registered user, are not allowed.
- There is a page which displays all the internships being posted on the application. This page is accessible to everyone irrespective of whether the user is even logged in.
- A student is able to apply to any internship he may want. If the student has already applied for an internship, he is restricted from applying again. If the user is not logged in, it redirects to the login page. And if the user is logged in as an employer, he is not allowed to apply.
- The employer is able to see all the application he has received for his internships.
